INSTRUCTIONS FOR CRAWLING:

Inside of lib/assets there is a folder called scraper_links.

Inside of that is a text file with your name on it.

Go into the runner.rb file within lib/assets. Modify line 11 so that it reads
"scraper_links/YOURNAME.txt" instead of "scraper_links/test.txt"

Then, making sure you are in the chord-explorer/lib/assets folder, call:

ruby runner.rb

If it's working, you should see a bunch of json objects popping up on your screen.

And... that's kinda it! The average artist has maybe 35 tabs. We will be grabbing
30 tabs per minute. With each of us responsible for 2180 artists, it may be...
36 minutes? Hopefully?
